    <p>The Times of India (TOI) is an Indian English-language daily newspaper and digital news media owned by the Bennett, Coleman & Co. Ltd. (BCCL) and the larger Times Group.
         Established in 1838 as The Bombay Times and Journal of Commerce, it is the oldest English-language newspaper in India</p>
    <p>Over its long history, which includes being known as "The Old Lady of Bori Bunder," 
        TOI has grown to be one of the most widely circulated newspapers in India and the world's largest-selling English-language daily. 
        The paper provides a broad range of content through numerous city-specific supplements like Delhi Times and Bombay Times, and special-interest publications such as Education Times and Times Ascent.</p>     
    <p>While it is a dominant media force, it has also faced controversy, notably concerning the institutionalization of "paid news" in the industry, where favorable coverage is exchanged for payment or financial stakes.
         Despite such criticism, it remains a highly influential publication with a wide readership across India.</p><br><br>
