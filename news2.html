    <h1 align="center">Hijabi Controversy in Kochi School</h1>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> October 17,2025</p>
    <p> kochi: An 8th-grade Muslim student was barred from entering her classroom at St. Rita’s Public School because she wore a hijab, which the school claims violates its prescribed uniform policy.  
    According to her parents, she was made to stand outside the classroom, asked to remove the headscarf, and was even mocked by some teachers if she insisted on wearing it. 
After the issue escalated — including a two-day closure of the school and protests involving parents — Kerala’s Education Minister V. Sivankutty stepped in. 
He cited a report by the Deputy Director of Education (DDE), which described the school’s actions as a serious lapse, “contrary to constitutional protections of religious freedom and the Right to Education.”  
The minister directed the school to allow the student to wear the hijab in class, leaving discretion to the school only over its colour or design. 
The school, on its part, has maintained that the uniform rules were communicated at the time of admission 
— including that a headscarf was not part of the uniform.  There were conflicting accounts about whether the parent and student had agreed to follow the uniform rule.
 At one point, a meeting was held between the student’s father, school authorities, and local leaders (including MP Hibi Eden), after which the father reportedly agreed to abide by the school’s rules. 
While the school reopened after two days, the concerned student was absent, citing health issues.  Meanwhile, police presence was increased at the school premises to maintain order. 
The case has raised several legal and constitutional questions: the balance between school uniform policies versus religious freedom, the role of state education authorities versus school management 
(especially for CBSE-affiliated schools), and the need to ensure that no student is deprived of education on grounds of religious attire.</p>
