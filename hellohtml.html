    <h3>The history of india</h3>
    <p>the wikepedia mentions<blockquote>india's long history begins with the Indus Valley Civilization (c. 2500-1900 BCE), followed by the Vedic period and the rise of kingdoms like Magadha. Major empires such as the Mauryas and Guptas followed, ushering in a <q>golden age</q> of cultural and scientific advancements. The subcontinent later saw the rise of the Mughal Empire, the British East India Company, and the British Raj, leading to modern India's independence in 1947. </blockquote></p>

    <p>In the deep niches in history, few names shine as brightly as that of <span style="color: aqua;"> Megasthenes,</span> a Greek historian and diplomat of the 4th century BCE. He is rightly celebrated as the <q>Father of Indian History</q> for his remarkable accounts of ancient India, during his tenure as a diplomat in the court of King Chandragupta Maurya.
