    <p><strong>Date:</strong> October 17,2025</p>
    <p> Pathnamthitta : In a significant development in the Sabarimala gold theft case, Unnikrishnan Potty, identified as the prime accused, 
        was arrested by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) after extensive interrogation. Potty, a Bengaluru-based businessman, had 
        been entrusted with the task of gold-plating temple artifacts at the Sabarimala shrine. However, investigations revealed that
         he misappropriated approximately 475.9 grams of gold, originally part of the gold-plated covers of the templeâ€™s sacred elements,
          including the dwarapalaka idols and Sreekovil frames, which were never returned to the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) after being 
          handed to a Chennai firm, Smart Creations, for re-plating in 2019. This case has stirred significant public and media attention,
           raising concerns about corruption and mismanagement within the TDB. The investigation is ongoing, with authorities making notable 
           progress, particularly with Potty's arrest, which suggests deeper institutional involvement.</p>
